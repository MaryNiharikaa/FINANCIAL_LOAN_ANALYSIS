# FINANCIAL_LOAN_ANALYSIS

Bank loans are a crucial financial tool that enables individuals and businesses to achieve their goals and manage financial needs. However, it's essential for borrowers to understand the terms, costs, and responsibilities associated with loans to make informed financial decisions.
Banks collect loan data through various channels and processes, including:
Loan Applications: When individuals or businesses apply for loans, they submit detailed applications that include personal and financial information. This data is collected electronically or in paper form.
Credit Reports: Banks often access credit reports from credit bureaus when assessing a borrower's creditworthiness. These reports contain information about a person's credit history, existing loans, and payment behaviour.
Internal Records: Banks maintain internal records of loan transactions, including disbursements, repayments, and loan status changes. These records are generated and stored in the bank's database.
Online Portals: Many banks offer online platforms where borrowers can apply for loans, make payments, and access account information. Data from these portals is collected and stored for analysis.
Third-party Data Sources: Some banks may use external data sources, such as income verification services, to gather additional information about borrowers.



# PROBLEM STATEMENT
# DASHBOARD|SUMMARY
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:
1.	Total Loan Applications: We need to calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Additionally, it is essential to monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track changes Month-over-Month (MoM).
2.	Total Funded Amount: Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial. We also want to keep an eye on the MTD Total Funded Amount and analyse the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes in this metric.
3.	Total Amount Received: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment. We should analyse the Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Received and observe the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
4.	Average Interest Rate: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitoring the Month-over-Month (MoM) variations in interest rates will provide insights into our lending portfolio's overall cost.
5.	Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health. We need to compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations.

Loan Status Grid View
In order to gain a comprehensive overview of our lending operations and monitor the performance of loans, we aim to create a grid view report categorized by 'Loan Status.’ By providing insights into metrics such as 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Received,' 'Month-to-Date (MTD) Funded Amount,' 'MTD Amount Received,' 'Average Interest Rate,' and 'Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI),' this grid view will empower us to make data-driven decisions and assess the health of our loan portfolio.
CHARTS
1.	Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart):  To identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities
2.	Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map): To identify regions with significant lending activity and assess regional disparities
3.	Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart): To allow the client to understand the distribution of loans across various term lengths.
4.	Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart): How lending metrics are distributed among borrowers with different employment lengths, helping us assess the impact of employment history on loan applications.
5.	Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart): Will provide a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on the stated purposes of loans, aiding in the understanding of the primary reasons borrowers seek financing.
6.	Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map): For a hierarchical view of how home ownership impacts loan applications and disbursements.
